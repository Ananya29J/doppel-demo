# DoppelX

## ᓚ PROBLEM STATEMENT<br/>

Students often study without foresight, unaware how small habit changes shape future performance.
They wonder—what if I studied longer, took better breaks, or changed strategy?
Without experimentation, learning becomes guesswork.
We chose this problem to help students see not just where they are, but where they could be. <br/>

## ᓚ SOLUTION <br/>

DoppelX — an AI-driven twin that mirrors your learning habits, simulates your possible outcomes, and helps you find your best path.

* Upload your study data — hours, breaks, sleep, grades.
* Watch your Doppelgänger simulate “what-if” versions of you.
* Get personalized strategies and outcomes before you take risks.
* Use it as your study buddy — host “study with me” sessions, stay accountable, and grow with your AI companion.
